For a junior frontend developer role, companies usually test your problem-solving skills with **DSA fundamentals** rather than extremely complex algorithms. Hereâ€™s what you should focus on:

## âœ… **Core Topics to Cover in DSA**

### **1. Arrays and Strings (High Priority)**  
- Basics: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion.  
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search.  
- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort.  
- Sliding Window and Two Pointer Techniques.  
- Prefix Sum, Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray).  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Find the largest/smallest element.  
- Check for duplicates.  
- Reverse a string or array.  
- Implement a sorting algorithm.  
- Two Sum, Remove Duplicates.  

---

### **2. Hashing (High Priority)**  
- HashMap and HashSet.  
- Frequency Count and Pattern Matching.  
- Detecting Cycles in Arrays.  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- First non-repeating character.  
- Find missing and duplicate numbers.  
- Group Anagrams.  

---

### **3. Linked Lists (Medium Priority)**  
- Single and Doubly Linked Lists.  
- Reversal and Merging.  
- Detecting a Cycle (Floydâ€™s Cycle Algorithm).  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Reverse a Linked List.  
- Detect and Remove a Cycle.  
- Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists.  

---

### **4. Stack and Queue (Medium Priority)**  
- Implement using Arrays or Linked Lists.  
- Evaluate Expressions (Postfix, Prefix).  
- Sliding Window Maximum.  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Valid Parentheses.  
- Implement Min Stack.  
- Implement Queue using Stack.  

---

### **5. Recursion and Backtracking (Medium Priority)**  
- Fibonacci, Factorials.  
- Permutations and Combinations.  
- Subset Sum Problems.  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Generate Parentheses.  
- N-Queens Problem.  
- Subset Sum.  

---

### **6. Trees (Low Priority for Frontend)**  
- Basic Understanding of Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.  
- Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversal.  
- BFS and DFS.  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Check if a Tree is Balanced.  
- Find Height of a Tree.  
- Level Order Traversal.  

---

### **7. Bonus: Bit Manipulation and Math (Optional)**  
- XOR Problems.  
- Count Set Bits.  

**Problems to Practice:**  
- Find the single non-repeating number.  
- Check if a number is a power of two.  

---

## ðŸš€ **Preparation Strategy**
- **Daily Practice:** Solve 2-3 problems daily on platforms like **LeetCode** or **NeetCode**.  
- **Topic-Wise:** Spend 2 weeks covering Arrays, Strings, and Hashing. Then gradually move to Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.  
- **Mock Interviews:** Start mock tests after 4 weeks to simulate interview pressure.  
- **Analyze Solutions:** Learn different approaches to the same problem.

Data structures are broadly categorized into **two types**:  

## âœ… **1. Linear Data Structures**
- Elements are arranged in a **sequential** manner.
- Easy to implement and use.
- Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.

### ðŸ”Ž **Types of Linear Data Structures:**  
- **Array:** Fixed-size, stores elements of the same data type.  
- **Linked List:** Dynamic, stores data in nodes with pointers.  
- **Stack:** Follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle.  
- **Queue:** Follows **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle.  
- **Deque:** A double-ended queue allowing insertion and deletion from both ends.  

---

## âœ… **2. Non-Linear Data Structures**
- Data is stored in a **hierarchical** or interconnected manner.
- Suitable for representing complex relationships.
- Examples: Trees, Graphs.

### ðŸ”Ž **Types of Non-Linear Data Structures:**  
- **Tree:** A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.  
  - Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Heap.  
- **Graph:** Consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.  
  - Can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.  

---

## âœ… **Other Types of Data Structures**  
- **Hashing:** Key-value pairs for quick data retrieval using hash functions.  
- **Heap:** A specialized tree-based structure used for priority queues.  
- **Trie:** Efficient for searching words in a dictionary or implementing autocomplete.  
- **Set and Map:** Collection of unique elements or key-value pairs.
