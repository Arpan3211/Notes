   - **Bonus:** Add functionality to restrict the open state to only one section at a time.

   - **Bonus:** Add lap functionality to the stopwatch, allowing users to record multiple time laps.

7. **Rating System**

   - **Description:** Implement a star rating system where users can rate items by clicking on stars (1 to 5). Display the rating value and update it dynamically based on user interaction.
   - **Bonus:** Display the average rating based on multiple inputs from users.

8. **Pagination**
   - **Description:** Build a list of items with pagination, where users can navigate between different pages of the list. The component should dynamically display a subset of items based on the current page.
   - **Bonus:** Implement page size options (e.g., showing 10, 20, or 50 items per page).

### **Medium Level**

1. **Dynamic Form Creation**

   - **Description:** Create a form generator that renders different types of input fields (text, checkbox, radio buttons, etc.) based on a provided JSON configuration. Implement basic validation rules for required fields.
   - **Bonus:** Allow dynamic addition or removal of form fields based on user input.

2. **Sorting and Filtering Table**

   - **Description:** Build a sortable and filterable table where users can sort the rows by clicking on column headers, and filter rows based on specific criteria (e.g., search by name or filter by category).
   - **Bonus:** Implement multi-level sorting (e.g., sorting by multiple columns simultaneously).

3. **Image Carousel**

   - **Description:** Create an image carousel that allows users to scroll through a series of images using navigation arrows or dots. The carousel should loop back to the first image when reaching the last image.
   - **Bonus:** Add autoplay functionality that automatically moves to the next image, and pauses when the user hovers over the carousel.

4. **Multi-Step Form with Validation**

   - **Description:** Implement a multi-step form where users can navigate between different steps (e.g., personal information, address, payment). Validate each step before proceeding to the next one.
   - **Bonus:** Allow users to go back to previous steps and edit their inputs without losing data.

5. **Editable Table**

   - **Description:** Create a table where users can edit the data in individual cells. The changes should be reflected dynamically, and there should be an option to save or cancel changes for each row.
   - **Bonus:** Implement validation for cell inputs (e.g., numeric fields should only accept numbers).

6. **File Upload Component**

   - **Description:** Build a file upload component that allows users to upload images or documents and preview them before submission. The component should validate file types and size before upload.
   - **Bonus:** Add drag-and-drop support for file uploads.

7. **Shopping Cart**

   - **Description:** Implement a shopping cart where users can add items, remove items, update quantities, and view the total price. The total should update dynamically as items are added or removed.
   - **Bonus:** Handle edge cases like negative quantities or an empty cart.

8. **Drag and Drop List**
   - **Description:** Build a list of items where users can reorder the items by dragging and dropping them. The new order should be saved and reflected in the UI.
   - **Bonus:** Allow users to drag items between multiple lists.

---

### **Hard Level**

1. **Infinite Scroll**

   - **Description:** Implement infinite scrolling for a list of items where more items are fetched from an API as the user scrolls down the page. Handle loading states and errors when fetching data.
   - **Bonus:** Add filtering options while maintaining infinite scroll behavior.

2. **CRUD Operations with API**

   - **Description:** Build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application (e.g., a list of users or products) where users can add, edit, delete, and view items. Use APIs to fetch and update the data.
   - **Bonus:** Implement optimistic UI updates for smoother user experience.

3. **Real-time Chat Application**

   - **Description:** Create a real-time chat interface where users can send and receive messages instantly. Use WebSockets or server-sent events to simulate real-time messaging.
   - **Bonus:** Show typing indicators, message timestamps, and unread message counts.

4. **React Context with Theme Switcher**

   - **Description:** Implement a theme switcher (light/dark mode) using React Context to manage global state. The theme should persist across different components of the application.
   - **Bonus:** Save the user’s theme preference in `localStorage` and load it on subsequent visits.

5. **Sorting and Filtering Table (with advanced filtering and pagination)**

   - **Description:** Extend the sortable and filterable table by adding pagination and allowing multiple levels of filtering (e.g., by category, price range, etc.). The table should update dynamically as filters are applied or pagination is changed.
   - **Bonus:** Implement server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination using API requests.

6. **File Upload Component (with drag-and-drop and validation)**

   - **Description:** Extend the basic file upload component by adding support for drag-and-drop file uploads and file validation (e.g., maximum file size, allowed formats). Display error messages for invalid uploads.
   - **Bonus:** Show upload progress and handle multiple file uploads simultaneously.

7. **Multi-Step Form with Validation (advanced with API integration)**

   - **Description:** Build an advanced multi-step form that integrates with APIs at each step to fetch and submit data (e.g., getting city data based on the user’s country selection). Validate inputs before proceeding to the next step.
   - **Bonus:** Save the form progress locally and allow users to resume from where they left off.

8. **Infinite Scroll (with filtering, error handling)**
   - **Description:** Build an infinite scroll list with the ability to filter items while maintaining scroll position. Handle API errors gracefully and show a retry option when an error occurs.
   - **Bonus:** Add a "load more" button as a fallback for users who prefer clicking over scrolling.
